# Shopping list management

[This project](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/ListeDeCourse) is realized within the framework of the course "web development" of the [ESILV](https://www.esilv.fr).

It is a shopping list management (product, quantity) with a centralized server and various clients.

Several servers are available or to be developed.
Several clients are available or to be developed.

This project cannot be used as is in public. It does not contain any access rights or user management. The data entered are accessible to anyone who knows the existence of a server and its API.

The objective is to manipulate different web technologies and relatively simple APIs. It also allows to think about the problem of data synchronization between several users.

The solution used here will not necessarily be valid in all types of projects, but remains the simplest to set up: a management of the modifications log.
